# ❄️ Thermal Paste Replacement & CPU Cooling Optimization Project

**Device Example:** Lenovo ThinkPad / Dell Inspiron / older MacBook (if user-serviceable)  
**Skill Level:** Intermediate (but beginner-friendly with proper care)  
**Goal:** Remove old thermal paste, apply new high-quality paste, reduce temperatures, and improve CPU thermal performance.

Thermal paste replacement is a common IT maintenance task for older laptops that run hot, throttle, or make louder fan noise.  
This project demonstrates:

- safe laptop disassembly  
- removing heatsink assembly  
- cleaning old thermal compound  
- applying new thermal paste properly  
- reassembling and testing temperatures  
- documenting before/after thermal performance

## 🧩 Project Steps

### 1. Preparation
- Shut down laptop  
- Unplug charger  
- Hold power button 5 seconds to discharge  
- Removed bottom cover with Phillips screwdriver  
- Located cooling assembly (fan + copper heatpipes + heatsink)

### 2. Remove Heatsink Assembly
- Disconnected fan cable (if needed)  
- Unscrewed heatsink screws in the **reverse order of the numbers** printed on the CPU plate  
- Lifted heatsink straight upward  
- Exposed CPU die and old paste

### 3. Clean Old Thermal Paste
- Used **isopropyl alcohol 90%+**  
- Used lint-free wipes / coffee filter to avoid fibers  
- Cleaned CPU and heatsink until shiny metal again  
- Ensured no residue or dust remained

### 4. Apply Fresh Thermal Paste
Used one of the standard safe application methods:

- **Small “pea-sized” dot** in the center  
  or  
- **Very thin spread** (depending on preference)

Ensured:
- no air bubbles  
- no over-application  
- paste did not overflow to components  

### 5. Reinstall Heatsink
- Carefully aligned heatsink back onto CPU  
- Screwed down in the **exact numbered pattern**, tightening evenly  
- Reconnected fan cable  
- Reassembled bottom cover

### 6. Temperature Testing (Before/After)
Used stress test tools to compare results:

- Idle temperature  
- Full load temperature  
- Fan speed behavior  
- Throttling improvements  

Typical improvement: **5°C–20°C** depending on age and condition.

## ✔ Results
- CPU temperatures improved after replacing old paste  
- Fan noise reduced  
- Smoother performance under load  
- No overheating or throttling  
- Heatsink reinstalled with correct pressure

## 📸 Photos
Upload these to the `photos/` folder:

- old dried thermal paste  
- cleaned CPU & heatsink  
- new paste applied  
- heatsink reinstall  
- before/after temperature screenshots
