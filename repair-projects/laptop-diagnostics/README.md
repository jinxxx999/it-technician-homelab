## 🧩 Project Steps

### 1. Initial Inspection
- Turned off device and removed bottom cover  
- Inspected internal components for dust, loose parts, or damage  

### 2. Battery Health Check
**Mac:**  
- Opened **System Information → Power**  
- Collected cycle count, full charge capacity, and battery condition  
- Verified battery status (“Normal / Service Recommended”)

**Windows (optional):**  
- Ran `powercfg /batteryreport`  
- Checked wear level and design capacity  

### 3. RAM Reseating / Upgrade
- Located RAM slots  
- Released metal clips and removed RAM modules  
- Inserted RAM back securely (“click” on both sides)  
- Rebooted device  
- Verified memory was recognized  

### 4. Hardware Diagnostics
Ran the following tests:

#### **Mac**
- Apple Diagnostics (startup → hold **D**)  
- Checked for error codes  

#### **Windows**
- MemTest86 for memory stability  
- CrystalDiskInfo / SMART test for drive health  

### 5. Cooling and Fan Cleaning
- Used compressed air to remove dust from fans and vents  
- Checked for quieter and smoother fan operation
