# 💽 Laptop SSD Upgrade & Storage Expansion Project

**Device Example:** MacBook, Dell, Lenovo, or Windows laptop  
**Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Goal:** Safely replace or upgrade the SSD in a laptop, increase storage capacity, and optionally migrate the operating system.

SSD upgrades are a common way to improve system performance and storage space. This project demonstrates:

- safe laptop disassembly  
- identifying and removing the existing SSD  
- installing a new SSD (SATA or M.2 NVMe)  
- optional OS migration or cloning  
- verifying new drive detection  
- documenting before/after storage status

## 🧩 Project Steps

### 1. Power Down & Prepare
- Shut down the laptop  
- Disconnect charger  
- Hold power button 5 seconds  
- Remove bottom cover using proper screwdriver  

### 2. Locate Existing SSD
- Identify drive type: SATA, M.2 SATA, or M.2 NVMe  
- Note current drive capacity and health (optional screenshot)  

### 3. Remove Old SSD
- Unscrew any mounting bracket screws  
- Slide or lift the drive carefully  
- Avoid touching connectors  

### 4. Install New SSD
- Insert new SSD into the same slot  
- Secure with screws or bracket  
- Ensure proper orientation and firm connection  

### 5. Optional: OS Migration or Drive Cloning
- Use tools like **Macrium Reflect**, **Carbon Copy Cloner**, or **Time Machine**  
- Clone the old drive to the new SSD (if replacing boot drive)  
- Alternatively, perform a clean OS install  

### 6. Boot & Verify
- Power on laptop  
- Verify BIOS/UEFI detects new SSD  
- Check drive capacity in OS (Disk Utility on Mac, Disk Management on Windows)  
- Optionally run read/write benchmark

## ✔ Results
- SSD successfully installed  
- Drive recognized by BIOS and OS  
- Increased storage capacity or faster drive speeds  
- System booted successfully (if cloning OS)  
- Optional performance improvement confirmed
