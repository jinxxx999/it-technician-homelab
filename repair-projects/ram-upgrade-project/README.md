**Device Example:** Lenovo ThinkPad / Dell Inspiron / Mac (if supported)  
**Skill Level:** Beginner  
**Goal:** Safely upgrade or reseat laptop RAM, verify memory recognition, and document the process.

This project focuses on core IT repair technician skills:
- opening a laptop safely
- identifying RAM slots and module types
- removing RAM using proper technique
- inserting RAM correctly (alignment + click)
- testing system boot and memory recognition
- running a basic memory test

These are real-world skills used daily in K–12 schools, repair shops, and IT support roles.
